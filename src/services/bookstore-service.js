      "description": "<p>The origin of the terms red and blue oceans comes from Blue Ocean Strategy – How to Create Uncontested Market Space and Make the Competition Irrelevant.</p>  <p>Recognized as one of the most iconic and impactful strategy books ever written, Blue Ocean Strategy argues that cutthroat competition results in nothing but a bloody red ocean of rivals fighting over a shrinking profit pool. It presents a systematic approach to making the competition irrelevant and outlines principles and tools any organization can use to create and capture their own blue oceans.</p><p>Blue ocean strategy is the simultaneous pursuit of differentiation and low cost to open up a new market space and create new demand. It is about creating and capturing uncontested market space, thereby making the competition irrelevant. It is based on the view that market boundaries and industry structure are not a given and can be reconstructed by the actions and beliefs of industry players.</p><p><b>Red oceans</b> are all the industries in existence today – the known market space. In red oceans, industry boundaries are defined and accepted, and the competitive rules of the game are known. Here, companies try to outperform their rivals to grab a greater share of existing demand. As the market space gets crowded, profits and growth are reduced. Products become commodities, leading to cutthroat or ‘bloody’ competition. Hence the term red oceans.</p><p><b>Blue oceans</b>, in contrast, denote all the industries not in existence today – the unknown market space, untainted by competition. In blue oceans, demand is created rather than fought over. There is ample opportunity for growth that is both profitable and rapid.In blue oceans, competition is irrelevant because the rules of the game are waiting to be set. A blue ocean is an analogy to describe the wider, deeper potential to be found in unexplored market space. A blue ocean is vast, deep, and powerful in terms of profitable growth.</p>",

The titular \"rich dad\" is purportedly his friend's father who accumulated wealth due to entrepreneurship and savvy investing, while the \"poor dad\" is claimed to be Kiyosaki's own father who he says worked hard all his life but never obtained financial security. However, no one has ever proven that Rich Dad, the man who supposedly gave Kiyosaki all his advice for wealthy living, ever existed. Nor has anyone ever documented any vast reserves of wealth earned by Kiyosaki prior to the publication of Rich Dad Poor Dad in 1997.</p>",

      "description": "<p>The Richest Man in Babylon is a 1926 book by George S. Clason that dispenses financial advice through a collection of parables set 4,000 years ago in ancient Babylon. The book remains in print almost a century after the parables were originally published, and is regarded as a classic of personal financial advice.</p><p>The parables are told by a fictional Babylonian character called Arkad, a poor scribe who became the \"richest man in Babylon\". Included in Arkad's advice are the \"Seven Cures\" (or how to generate money and wealth), and the \"Five Laws of Gold\" (or how to protect and invest wealth). A core part of Arkad's advice is around \"paying yourself first\", \"living within your means\", \"investing in what you know\", the importance of \"long-term saving\", and \"home ownership\".</p><p>The content is from a series of pamphlets distributed by U.S. banks and insurance companies in 1920–24; the pamphlets were bound together and published as a book in 1926. The book is often referred to as a classic of personal financial advice, and appears in modern recommended reading lists on personal financial advice and wealth management, which has kept the book in print almost 90 years after its first edition with over 2 million copies sold.</p>",

      "description": "<p>The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment is a book by Eckhart Tolle. The book is intended to be a guide for day-to-day living and stresses the importance of living in the present moment and transcending thoughts of the past or future.Published in the late 1990s, the book was recommended by Oprah Winfrey and has been translated into 33 languages. As of 2009, it was estimated that three-million copies had been sold in North America.</p><p>The book draws from a variety of \"spiritual traditions\", and has been described by one reviewer as \"Buddhism mixed with mysticism and a few references to Jesus Christ, a sort of New Age re-working of Zen.\" It uses these traditions to describe a \"belief system based on living in the present moment\". Its core message is that people's emotional problems are rooted in their identification with their minds. The author writes that an individual should be aware of their \"present moment\" instead of losing themselves in worry and anxiety about the past or future.</p><p>According to the book, only the present moment is real and only the present moment matters, and both an individual's past and future is created by their thoughts. The author maintains that people's insistence that they have control of their life is an illusion \"that only brings pain\". The book also describes methods of relaxation and meditation to aid readers in anchoring themselves in the present. These suggestions include slowing down life by avoiding multi-tasking, spending time in nature, and letting go of worries about the future. Some of the concepts contained in The Power of Now, such as the human ego and its negative effects on happiness, are further elaborated in the author's later books, in particular A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose (2005).</p>",

      "description": "<p>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, first published in 1989, is a business and self-help book written by Stephen Covey. Covey presents an approach to being effective in attaining goals by aligning oneself to what he calls \"true north\" principles based on a character ethic that he presents as universal and timeless.</p><p>Covey defines effectiveness as the balance of obtaining desirable results with caring for that which produces those results. He illustrates this by referring to the fable of the goose that laid the golden eggs. He further claims that effectiveness can be expressed in terms of the P/PC ratio, where P refers to getting desired results and PC is caring for that which produces the results.</p><p>Covey's best-known book has sold more than 25 million copies worldwide since its first publication. The audio version became the first non-fiction audio-book in U.S. publishing history to sell more than one million copies. Covey argues against what he calls \"the personality ethic\", that he sees as prevalent in many modern self-help books. He promotes what he labels \"the character ethic\": aligning one's values with so-called universal and timeless principles. In doing this, Covey distinguishes principles and values. He sees principles as external natural laws, while values remain internal and subjective. Our values govern our behavior, while principles ultimately determine the consequences. Covey presents his teachings in a series of habits, manifesting as a progression from dependence through independence on to interdependence.</p>",

Cain argues that modern Western culture misunderstands and undervalues the traits and capabilities of introverted people, leading to \"a colossal waste of talent, energy, and happiness\".</p><p>The book presents a history of how Western culture transformed from a culture of character to a culture of personality in which an \"extrovert ideal\" dominates and introversion is viewed as inferior or even pathological. Adopting scientific definitions of introversion and extroversion as preferences for different levels of stimulation, Quiet outlines the advantages and disadvantages of each temperament, emphasizing the myth of the extrovert ideal that has dominated in the West since the early twentieth century. Asserting that temperament is a core element of human identity, Cain cites research in biology, psychology, neuroscience and evolution to demonstrate that introversion is both common and normal, noting that many of humankind's most creative individuals and distinguished leaders were introverts. Cain urges changes at the workplace, in schools, and in parenting; offers advice to introverts for functioning in an extrovert-dominated culture; and offers advice in communication, work, and relationships between people of differing temperament.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Secrets of the Millionaire Mind reveals the missing link between wanting success and achieving it!</p><p>Have you ever wondered why some people seem to get rich easily, while others are destined for a life of financial struggle? Is the difference found in their education, intelligence, skills, timing, work habits, contacts, luck, or their choice of jobs, businesses, or investments?</p><p>The shocking answer is: None of the above!</p><p>In his groundbreaking Secrets of the Millionaire Mind, T. Harv Eker states: 'Give me five minutes, and I can predict your financial future for the rest of your life!' Eker does this by identifying your 'money and success blueprint.' We all have a personal money blueprint ingrained in our subconscious minds, and it is this blueprint, more than anything, that will determine our financial lives. You can know everything about marketing, sales, negotiations, stocks, real estate, and the world of finance, but if your money blueprint is not set for a high level of success, you will never have a lot of money—and if somehow you do, you will most likely lose it! The good news is that now you can actually reset your money blueprint to create natural and automatic success.</p><p>Secrets of the Millionaire Mind is two books in one. Part I explains how your money blueprint works. Through Eker's rare combination of street smarts, humor, and heart, you will learn how your childhood influences have shaped your financial destiny. You will also learn how to identify your own money blueprint and 'revise' it to not only create success but, more important, to keep and continually grow it.</p><p>In Part II you will be introduced to seventeen 'Wealth Files,' which describe exactly how rich people think and act differently than most poor and middle-class people. Each Wealth File includes action steps for you to practice in the real world in order to dramatically increase your income and accumulate wealth.</p><p>If you are not doing as well financially as you would like, you will have to change your money blueprint. Unfortunately your current money blueprint will tend to stay with you for the rest of your life, unless you identify and revise it, and that's exactly what you will do with the help of this extraordinary book. According to T. Harv Eker, it's simple. If you think like rich people think and do what rich people do, chances are you'll get rich too!</p>",

      "description": "<p>No matter your goals, Atomic Habits offers a proven framework for improving--every day. James Clear, one of the world's leading experts on habit formation, reveals practical strategies that will teach you exactly how to form good habits, break bad ones, and master the tiny behaviors that lead to remarkable results.</p><p>If you're having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn't you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. Here, you'll get a proven system that can take you to new heights.</p><p>Clear is known for his ability to distill complex topics into simple behaviors that can be easily applied to daily life and work. Here, he draws on the most proven ideas from biology, psychology, and neuroscience to create an easy-to-understand guide for making good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible. Along the way, readers will be inspired and entertained with true stories from Olympic gold medalists, award-winning artists, business leaders, life-saving physicians, and star comedians who have used the science of small habits to master their craft and vault to the top of their field.</p><p>Learn how to:•  make time for new habits (even when life gets crazy);•  overcome a lack of motivation and willpower;•  design your environment to make success easier;•  get back on track when you fall off course;...and much more.</p><p>Atomic Habits will reshape the way you think about progress and success, and give you the tools and strategies you need to transform your habits--whether you are a team looking to win a championship, an organization hoping to redefine an industry, or simply an individual who wishes to quit smoking, lose weight, reduce stress, or achieve any other goal.</p>",
